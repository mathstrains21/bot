    Branding repository abstraction.

    This class represents the branding repository's main branch and exposes available events and assets
    as objects. It performs the necessary amount of validation to ensure that a misconfigured event
    isn't returned. Such events are simply ignored, and will be substituted with the fallback event,
    if available. Warning logs will inform core developers if a misconfigured event is encountered.

    Colliding events cause no special behaviour. In such cases, the first found active event is returned.
    We work with the assumption that the branding repository checks for such conflicts and prevents them
    from reaching the main branch.

    This class keeps no internal state. All `get_current_event` calls will result in GitHub API requests.
    The caller is therefore responsible for being responsible and caching information to prevent API abuse.
